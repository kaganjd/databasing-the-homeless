# Databasing the Homeless
This is a WIP sketch of what could be a larger project about data and databases, knowledge production, and the electronic turn in social services. It's inspired by Craig Willse's 2016 book, "The Value of Homelessness: Managing Surplus Life in the United States"—specifically, the "Governing through Numbers" chapter.

The text is clipped from interviews done as part of a 2011-2013 project called "Signs for the Homeless". It's a problematic source, and I'm interested in making another version with clips from Joe Bernstein's 2016 article in the Seattle Weekly, "Stealing From the Homeless".

In disrupting the data field this way, the idea is to show how databases constrain the kinds of information we can know about a person. The resulting "statistical portraits," to use Willse's phrase, stand in for a population that doesn't actually exist until the database brings it into being. This reality has important applications for how we use databases (and algorithms that rely on them) to create and inform policy.
