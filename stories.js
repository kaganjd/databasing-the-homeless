My mom was a caterer and my father was in construction until he had an accident on the job. Our mother was truly the backbone of our family. When she passed, all of the siblings scattered and we have been disconnected ever since.",
		    "text2": "My husband lost his job (truck driving) around the same time I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a cancerous tumor in my neck. I was a stay-at-home mom. We had a house, two cars, and two motorcycles less than three years ago. We now only have each other.",

He says that since he has been sober, he “has been out of trouble.” When I told him I would stop by again soon, he told me that it wasn’t necessary–“you don’t have to buy a sign anymore!” He spends his days and nights near South Station.",

I hope that people read this and understand… no one sets out to be on the street. Its just that life happens, and it can happen to anyone. Growing up I was told not to judge anyone, so I hope people don’t judge me.",

Unfortunately, when you’re living on the street you get exposed to different things and so I started taking drugs. It is something that I constantly battle with everyday."

In actuality, I probably do just as much good for the community as they do.  I know who the drug addicts, the rapists, the dealers, and the convicts are. I pray for them all in the streets, and I try to live by example as a Christian."

When I was a teenager, my siblings and I had to deal with a lot of violence and racism going to and from school everyday, so we are all very close."
